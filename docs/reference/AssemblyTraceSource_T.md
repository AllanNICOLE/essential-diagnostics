# AssemblyTraceSource<T> Class 

Enable applications to trace the execution of code and associate trace messages with a source named after the assembly the generic type.

## Installing

Install via NuGet:

* PM> **Install-Package [Essential.Diagnostics.Fluent](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Essential.Diagnostics.Fluent)**

## Remarks

This class provides a way to automatically configure trace sources based on the target class (specifically naming the source after the assembly the class is from),which works well with dependency injection frameworks.

If using a dependency injection framework, by simply declaring a dependency of type ITraceSource<T> and registering AssemblyTraceSource<T> with the dependency injection container, classes will automatically get an ITraceSource based on their assembly name.

## Example Remarks

See Examples\AbstractionDependency

* The Application class has a dependency on ITraceSource<Application> that can be supplied by construction injection. Using the generic and specifying the target class allows many dependency injection frameworks to automatically provide a corresponding instance of AssemblyTraceSource.

* AssemblyTraceSource automatically configures a trace source based on the name of the assembly that the generic class is from. This provides one trace source per assembly that needs to be configured and provides a balance between the amount of configuration required (less sources means less configuration) and the flexibility (more sources provides greater flexibility).

* The first test example shows how the generic interface can be stubbed out during testing with a specific mock implementation.

* Note however that using the generic interface is not necessary for testing your tracing code. You can test existing code, without rewriting it to use the interface, by utilising the InMemoryTraceListener.

The second test example shows how you can use InMemoryTraceListener in your test configuration, and then during testing get a reference to the listener. By clearing the listener before each test, and then checking the contents afterwards, you can apply unit testing to your trace messages in existing code.
