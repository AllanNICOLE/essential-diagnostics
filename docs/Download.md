# Downloading Essential.Diagnostics

The preferred method to integrate Essential.Diagnostics with your project is via the [Essential.Diagnostics NuGet package](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Essential.Diagnostics), which contains just the binaries needed to use the extensions (the same files are in the Binaries only download).

For the example project, which runs using Visual Web Developer 2010 Express, download the [Essential.Diagnostics Complete package](http://essentialdiagnostics.codeplex.com/releases) from CodePlex. The examples project contains a reference to the NuGet package.
