| [AssemblyTraceSource<T>](AssemblyTraceSource_T_)![EX](Abstractions_ex.png) | Enable applications to trace the execution of code and associate trace messages with a source named after the assembly the generic type is from. |
| [ITraceSource](ITraceSource)![EX](Abstractions_ex.png) | Defines a set of methods and properties that enable applications to trace the execution of code and associate trace messages with their source.  |
| [ITraceSource<T>](ITraceSource_T_)![EX](Abstractions_ex.png) | Defines a set of methods and properties that enable applications to trace the execution of code and associate trace messages with a source related to a specific class. |
| [TraceSourceWrapper](TraceSourceWrapper)![EX](Abstractions_ex.png) | Provides a wrapper around TraceSource that implements the ITraceSource interface, enable applications to trace the execution of code and associate trace messages with their source in a decoupled manner. |
