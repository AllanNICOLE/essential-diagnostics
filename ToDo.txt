Features TODO
-------------

- Add XmlTraceListener; using format from XmlWriterT-L (rather than TextWriterT-L) but with rotating log features from FileLogT-L.

- Add HttpContext items (if available) to TraceFormatter.

- Add FileTraceListener; with formatted output as well as file rotation.

- Add ITraceSource and TraceSourceWrapper in Diagnostics.Abstractions; for alternative DI of trace (even though TraceListener is already abstract).

- Add MinimumTrustTraceSource; for use in low-trust environments.

- Improve TraceConfigurationMonitor to support system.diagnostics section in separate config file.

File logging example (using VB logger), which version of VB, example settings
