Using and extending System.Diagnostics trace logging. 

Provides a templated interface and implementation that makes tracing
structured data easy via System.Diagnostics, using a fluent interface. 
Information is traced as StructuredData, with a message template, 
template values, and additional properties. 

Structured trace information is forwarded to an underlying TraceSource,
which then sends to any configured TraceListeners, e.q. a Seq server.
The interface can be used for easy integration with a dependency 
injection framework.

Other Essential.Diagnostics packages extend the .NET Framework 
System.Diagnostics trace logging with additional trace listeners. 
Included are colored console (that allows custom formats), 
SQL database (including a tool to create tables), rolling file 
(with custom formats), rolling XML, email (per trace or batched), 
and an in-memory trace listener.

The Essential.Diagnostics project also publishes structured data
(semantic) tracing extensions and a fluent client library that 
includes easy encapsulation of activity and logical operation scopes, 
as well as abstractions and templated classes for a simpler 
logging API and support for dependency injection frameworks.

See the project site on GitHub for examples and documentation.
