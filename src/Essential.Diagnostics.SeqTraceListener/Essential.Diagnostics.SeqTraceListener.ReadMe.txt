Using and extending System.Diagnostics trace logging. 

Seq trace listener extension for System.Diagnostics, along with 
required config sections. Writes to the specified Seq server URL, 
with additional properties as configured.

You need to have a Seq server (https://getseq.net/) installed
to send the trace events to. The local development server version
is fine. This trace listener supports structured (semantic) data,
either directly or via Essential.Diagnostics.StructuredExtensions.

Other Essential.Diagnostics packages extend the .NET Framework 
System.Diagnostics trace logging with additional trace listeners. 
Included are colored console (that allows custom formats), 
SQL database (including a tool to create tables), rolling file 
(with custom formats), rolling XML, email (per trace or batched), 
and an in-memory trace listener.

The Essential.Diagnostics project also publishes structured data
(semantic) tracing extensions and a fluent client library that 
includes easy encapsulation of activity and logical operation scopes, 
as well as abstractions and templated classes for a simpler 
logging API and support for dependency injection frameworks.

See the project site on CodePlex for examples and documentation.
