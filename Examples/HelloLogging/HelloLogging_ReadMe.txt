Essential.Diagnostics - Hello Logging Example
=============================================

Example configuration files for common trace listeners.

Instructions
------------

1. Build the application.
2. You can run the main application, which is configured to use the ConsoleTraceListener.
3. The application EXE is also copied to subdirectories with different configurations (see below).

Configurations
--------------

This example shows configurations both using the built-in .NET Framework trace listeners, 
as well as extended listeners from the Essential.Diagnostics pack.

Framework listeners
-------------------

Cosole - .NET Framework ConsoleTraceListener; plain logging to the console.

EventLog - .NET Framework EventLogTraceListener; logs to the Windows Event Log. 
Note: Requires Administrator permissions to create the event log (normally this would be configured during installation).

FileLog - .NET Framework FileLogTraceListener (from the VisualBasic namespace); logs to a text file, creating new 
log files as necessary (e.g. on a schedule, such as daily, or when a maximum size is reached).

XmlWriter - .NET Framework XmlWriterTraceListener; logs E2ETraceEvent XML fragments to a text file that can be opened 
in the Service Trace Viewer.

Essential.Diagnostics listeners
-------------------------------

ColoredConsole - Essential.Diagnostics.ColoredConsoleTraceListener that logs to the console using configurable colors 
and with a configurable message template.

InMemory - Essential.Diagnostics.InMemoryTraceListener

RollingFile - Essential.Diagnostics.RollingFileTraceListener that logs to a text file, creating new files on a schedule
(such as daily), and with a configurable message template.

RollingXml - Essential.Diagnostics.RollingXmlTraceListener that logs E2ETraceEvent XML fragments to a text file that
can be opened in the Service Trace Viewer tool, creating new files on a schedule (such as daily).

SqlDatabase - Essential.Diagnostics.SqlDatabaseTraceListener that logs to a SQL database.
Note: Use the diagnostics_regsql.exe tool to create the required database.
